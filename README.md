# tree-sitter-fennel

I'm a big fan of [sogaiu's TS grammar for
Clojure](https://github.com/sogaiu/tree-sitter-clojure), and when I switched my neovim
config to fennel, I ran into problems trying to use the existing [tree-sitter-fennel
grammar](https://github.com/TravonteD/tree-sitter-fennel). So in the spirit of Rich
Hickey, I'm making my own. We'll see how I do.

Cribbing heavily from both of the above repos, so I'm using the MIT license to share the
code.
